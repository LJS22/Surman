							<ul>
								<li>Many children in our society are homeless and go without food or shelter</li><br>
								<li>We believe every child has the right to a happy childhood</li><br>
								<li>Through our Palna Project we provide children a home to live in</li><br>
								<li>Here children of all ages irrespective of caste, creed or religion can live in house as a family</li><br>
								<li>We currently have 34 infants and 94 children</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='projectText' data-id='education'>
							<ul>
								<li>There is a fundamental lack of education in the most poverty stricken areas of our country</li>
								<li>Parents in slums do not support education as the children must work to support their families</li>
								<li>We believe education empowers individuals to become more productive members of society</li>
								<li>Here we not only support children through their education with books, schoolbags and clothes but we educate the parents on its benefits as well as healthcare, nutrition and why girls should also pursue education</li>
								<li>We also teach basic life skills such as hygiene, cooking and budgeting</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='projectText' data-id='women'>
							<ul>
								<li>This project provides a home to the vulnerable women of society</li>
								<li>Sadly many women have seen the darker side to life such as domestic violence, sexual abuse and prostitution</li>
								<li>These women are incorporated into the family and take on roles such as care givers and caretakers</li>
								<li>We also teach these women to read, write and to be productive members of society, allowing them to break the poverty cycle</li>
								<li>Studies have shown having a literate female population is linked to reducing population growth</li>
								<li>We currently have taken in 11 women</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='projectText' data-id='slums'>
							<ul>
								<li>Many children unfortunately live and work on the street amidst rubbish, animals and open sewers</li>
								<li>They are mostly unvaccinated and do not receive any medical treatments</li>
								<li>They live and work on the streets because their parents are poor, dead or they have ran away from abuse</li>
								<li>This issue leads to child labour, child prostitution and sexual exploitation which is unacceptable in todays society</li>
								<li>Our mission is to provide an adequate home, clothing, education, medical aid and nourishment to those who need it most to combat these issues</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='projectText' data-id='home'>
							<ul>
								<li>The ultimate goal of this project is to build a seven storey building where 1200 children can have a home</li>
								<li>The land has been bought and initial construction has started however it is still a large project</li>
								<li>This facility will provide all basic amenities; free education, food, medical assistance as well as many recreational activities e.g. dance classes, painting workshops, games room and a swimming pool</li>
								<li>We urgently seek your co-operation in any way you can to make this dream come true for those who need it</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class='projectText' data-id='medicine'>
							<ul>
								<li>A distress call from two helpless parents pleading for urgent medical support birthed our Jeevan project</li>
								<li>We started temporary adoption of children whose parents could not afford appropriate medical care</li>
								<li>We now work with teams of generous and dedicated doctors who provide free or subsidised services</li>
								<li>Up until now we have provided full free medical assistance, including surgery to 40 children and adults as well as rehabilitating 300 children back with their parents from all over India and even Nepal</li>
								<li>We require your support to keep this project alive</li>
